# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🧙‍♂

Hello there! I'm on a quest to become a software sorcerer, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Software Development from BYU-Idaho 🎓. Along the way, I proudly graduated from HarvardX's CS50 and am currently juggling Web Programming with Python and JavaScript there. 🤹‍♂

But I'm not just about coding spells - I'm a multitasking maestro 🎩, wielding skills in admin wizardry, customer service charm, and logistics magic. 🪄

I try my best to go beyond the ordinary, being the problem-solving superhero that **you** need! 💪 Whether it's debugging code or lending a hand to teammates, I'm on a mission to save the day. 🦸‍♂

Expectations? I don't just meet them, I leap over them in a single bound! 🚀 Let's have a chat and see how I can add a touch of magic to **your** team. 🔮
